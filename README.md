# Masked_Face_Detector
This repo contains a masked face detector in which, three machine learning models are used for the prediction that a person in an image is wering a mask or not.

Masked face detection on self constructed dataset using SVM, KNN &amp; MLP

                                      How to get to our project
● Download the .ipynb file provided in the zip folder.

● Open google colaboratory on any web browser.

● Upload that ipynb file on that collab note book.

● Load the zipped dataset folder into the colab notebook.

● Create a new empty folder named “Dataset” as in order to unzip the folder and
extract all the data from that, all the dataset should be stored in a newly created
new empty folder named “Dataset”.

● You can see all the code in blocks and their results

● If you want to re-run the code then press ctrl+enter to run a particular block and
ctrl + F9 to run the whole colab notebook at once.

                                   Structure and Process of Execution
● Our project is on Face masked detection which detects masked faces.

● Tried different classifiers and finally used three different classifiers which are
K nearest neighbour, Multilayer Perceptron and Support vectors machines.

● Used different methods to increase the accuracy of the classifiers by using grid
search over different parameters to find the best parameter to be fitted in the
model.

● Structure : Program consists of 3 models,K nearest neighbour, Multilayer
Perceptron and SVM.

● The best result Comes out for the SVM model which is approx 98% followed by
KNN which is 87% followed by MLP.
